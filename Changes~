Revision history for Perl extension {{$dist->name}}

{{$NEXT}}
    - this module has been abandoned by his original author (MARCEL). This is
      just a maintenance release to make the module work correctly from the
      CPAN to be able to maintain others modules made by MARCEL.
    - fixed plugin names for many *Tests to Test::* as they have moved on CPAN
      (Olivier Mengu√©)
    - Known bugs: MANIFEST.SKIP generated by Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles
      is currently ignored by the ManifestSkip plugin in at least
      DZ 4.300010 and below, so MANIFEST.SKIP doesn't work. See RT#76036.
